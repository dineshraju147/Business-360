# Business Insights 360 - Power BI Project

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains my first Power BI project, **Business Insights 360**, developed with insights from Codebasics. The project focuses on delivering a **comprehensive, interactive, and insightful dashboard** that enhances data-driven decision-making across multiple business functions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Introduction
AtliQ Hardware encountered significant challenges due to reliance on outdated Excel files for business analytics. This lack of real-time insights led to substantial losses, particularly in Latin America. This Power BI dashboard provides a **unified view of business performance** across finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The primary goal is to develop an intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboard that empowers stakeholders to **extract meaningful insights and drive strategic growth** across AtliQ Hardwareâ€™s departments.

## ðŸ”Ž Power BI Dashboard Overview
This dashboard consists of multiple views tailored to different business functions:

âœ… **Home View**: A landing page with navigation icons to seamlessly switch between different sections.  
âœ… **Finance View**: Provides P&L statements, identifies top/bottom products, and analyzes customer net sales performance.  
âœ… **Sales View**: Displays customer performance based on net sales, gross margin, and gross margin %.  
âœ… **Marketing View**: Highlights segment performance with insights into Gross Margin % and Net Profit %.  
âœ… **Supply Chain View**: Tracks forecast accuracy, net error, and forecast accuracy % for supply chain optimization.  
âœ… **Executive View**: Summarizes key business KPIs, revenue contributions, top customers/products, and sub-region performance.
